## Project description

To be defined (see #11)

# Setup

0. Install the Android SDK. You don't need android studio, but if you wish you can install it as well.

1. Download Unity Hub.

2. Create an account.

3. Install **Unity 2018.4.11f1.**

4. Clone the project and have it open by Unity Hub. You may get lots of import errors now, just ignore them.

5. Install ARCore SDK for Unity (https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/quickstart-android) but do not open HelloAR.scene, just open `Navigation.scene` under `Assets/Scenes`. Instead, skip and setup Unity to detect your SDK.

6. Hopefully you should be able to launch a build now.

7. On your phone, install "Google Play Services for AR".

8. Install the generated apk at step 6 (either via adb or via issuing the 'build and run' command inside Unity).
